I've had to honor to work on truly\n        impactful projects in a fast paced, highly efficient team. Our team\n        focuses on high-level KPI metrics such as yield, throughput and cost for\n        every single step in the battery lifecycle.\n      </p>\n      <h5>The App</h5>\n      <p>\n        Starting from the core web application, I lead the design and creation\n        of multiple analytics dashboards, covering core factory metrics such as\n        yield, throughput and scrap cost. These dashboards have become critical\n        to the factory and its numbers are used to report weekly number to our\n        C-suite (and Mr Musk!). I truly believe that creating software products\n        that people love to use is just as important as the data we are\n        displaying. Thus I also started a component library and design system\n        that ended up speeding up our prototype process and allowed us to gain\n        more detailed and accurate user feedback. Because of this, our data\n        platform has become the #1 place our engineers and production leaders to\n        go to for kpi metrics.\n      </p>\n      <h5>The Data</h5>\n      <p>\n        With any data analytics platform, ensuring clean, accurate and low\n        latency data is crucial. I worked on a handful of critical data\n        pipelines using Airflow jobs and a clickhouse database (optimized for\n        aggregations!). With these projects we're able to create datasources\n        that are available nowhere else in Tesla, and enable us to build unique\n        and custom solutions for our customers.\n      </p>\n      <h5>The System</h5>\n      <p>\n        With a product as complex as a cybertruck cell, Tesla has built multiple\n        in-house tools to provide insights on many different aspects of the\n        manufacturing line. For example, while we work on high level metrics,\n        other platforms focus on machine level data. Part of my role has been\n        the exciting job of merging all those products together. To do this, I'm\n        working with a team of brilliant UI engineers to build a new app that\n        brings all those metrics into one shared place. With this, i've had the\n        opportunity to work on a wide distributed system of applications and\n        servers. I lead redesigns and reworks of existing applications to create\n        a cohesive and unuified system, and am currently also working on a new\n        service that centralizes common configurations.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  )\n);\n","// extracted by mini-css-extract-plugin\nexport default {};"],"names":["PageDetail","company","start","end","image","stack","content","github","link","this","Date","className","styles"],"sourceRoot":""}
