I've had to honor to work on truly\n        impactful projects in a fast paced, highly efficient team. Our team\n        focuses on high-level KPI metrics such as yield, throughput and cost for\n        every single step in the battery lifecycle.\n      </p>\n      <h5>The App</h5>\n      <p>\n        Starting from the core web application, I lead the design and creation\n        of multiple analytics dashboards, covering core factory metrics such as\n        yield, throughput and scrap cost. These dashboards have become critical\n        to the factory and its numbers are used to report weekly number to our\n        C-suite (and Mr Musk). They have allowed our production engineers to\n        make data-driven decisions and take corrective action to reduce our\n        scrap costs by 50%, save millions of dollars of material and improve\n        yield by 10%+ for each process within the factory.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Within our development team, I noticed a lack of design process which\n        caused us to have weak feedback loops with customers, and would often\n        waste engineering time to make changes. to solve this I started a\n        component library and design system that ended up speeding up our\n        prototype process by 90% and allowed us to gain more detailed and\n        accurate user feedback. Because of this, our development has decreased\n        by 25% and the data platform has become the #1 place our engineers and\n        production leaders to go to for kpi metrics.\n      </p>\n      <h5>The Data</h5>\n      <p>\n        With any data analytics platform, ensuring clean, accurate and low\n        latency data is crucial. I worked on a handful of critical data\n        pipelines using Airflow jobs, a clickhouse database and trino data\n        lakes. Our pipelines process 14M+ rows of data per day and we take into\n        consideration key factors such as scalability and data latency to make\n        decisions on whether certain data should follow ETL or ELT processing.\n        <p>\n          With these projects I have been able to contribute to datasources that\n          are available nowhere else in Tesla, and enable us to build unique and\n          custom solutions for our customers.\n        </p>\n      </p>\n      <h5>The System</h5>\n      <p>\n        With a product as complex as a cybertruck cell, Tesla has built multiple\n        in-house tools to provide insights on many different aspects of the\n        manufacturing line. For example, while we work on high level metrics,\n        other platforms focus on machine level data. Part of my role has been\n        the exciting job of merging all those products together. To do this, I'm\n        working with a team of brilliant UI and distributed systems engineers to\n        build a new app that brings all those metrics into one shared place.\n        With this, I've had the opportunity to work on a wide distributed system\n        of applications and servers. I lead redesigns and reworks of existing\n        applications to create a cohesive and unuified system.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I am currently also working on a GraphQL service to streamline\n        configuration management across 4 teams and elimiate individually\n        managed datasets. This not only reduces data redundancies by 50% but\n        also ensures scalable and safe management of configuration data.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  )\n);\n","// extracted by mini-css-extract-plugin\nexport default {};"],"names":["PageDetail","company","start","end","image","stack","content","github","link","this","Date","className","styles"],"sourceRoot":""}
