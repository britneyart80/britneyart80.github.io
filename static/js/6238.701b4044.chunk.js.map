The GA Immersive program\n        was a 12-week coding bootcamp where we learned essential technologies,\n        such as React, Bootstrap, MongoDB, Express, Ruby on Rails, ajax, axios\n        etc. This project was one of the SPA's I built during my time there.\n      </p>\n      <h5>The Process</h5>\n      <Row>\n        <p>\n          This was an individual project that we had 4 days to finish building,\n          including the front-end, backend and design. I planned out the project\n          first by coming up with an idea I was excited about. From there,\n          wireframes and user stories took place.\n        </p>\n      </Row>\n      <Row className={styles.centerFlex}>\n        <Col l={6} s={12}>\n          <Image path=\"prepper/wireframe1.png\" />\n        </Col>\n        <Col l={6} s={12}>\n          <Image path=\"prepper/wireframe2.png\" />\n        </Col>\n      </Row>\n      <Row className={styles.backend}>\n        <Col l={6} s={12}>\n          <Image path=\"prepper/backend.png\" />\n        </Col>\n        <Col l={6}>\n          <p>\n            After wireframes were set up, it was easier to understand what\n            functionality we needed and the backend endpoints required. I\n            created a map of the backend architecture which shows the\n            relationship between databases. I also created a catalog of CRUD\n            routes that were needed.\n          </p>\n        </Col>\n      </Row>\n      <p>\n        Once back-end was set up, I moved to implementing front-end\n        functionality and styling. Along the way, there were both front-end and\n        back-end bugs, and I utilized the terminal/browser console.logs() a lot\n        in the process of debugging. This helped me easily trace back to the\n        source of the problem. To reduce the amount of bug encounters, I always\n        planned out in my head how I wanted to implement the structure of\n        classes and functions before I began coding.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  ),\n  \"https://github.com/britneyart80/Prepper\"\n);\n","// extracted by mini-css-extract-plugin\nexport default {\"content\":\"prepper_content__SUfuQ\",\"backend\":\"prepper_backend__2owDo\"};"],"names":["PageDetail","company","start","end","image","stack","content","github","link","this","Date","className","styles","l","s","path"],"sourceRoot":""}
