As a Software Engineering Co-op on the Trust pod, I was in charge\n        of fixing bugs and developing new checkout features. We worked in a\n        salesforce integrated codebase and much of the code is linked to\n        salesforce configurations. Since checkout is an extremely important part\n        of the pipeline, it was integral that code was always thoroughly tested\n        through rounds of QA. After finishing my 6 month full-time co-op, I\n        continued working as a part time software engineer for 6 months.\n      </p>\n      <h5>Highlight: Brand Mode</h5>\n      <p>\n        In response to Covid-19 shipping blockages in certain areas of the\n        world, I worked with a group of senior engineers to develop 'Brand\n        mode'- a set of configurations that would allow us to toggle checkout on\n        and off depending on region and locale. This solved the issue by\n        stopping the customer from checking out if they were in a country that\n        ASICS could not ship to. I was tasked with implementing feature flags\n        into the code, allowing us to turn brand mode on and off for different\n        regions. Through this experience, I not only learned how experienced\n        teams work together under time pressure, but also got to gain experience\n        in how to come up with creative solutions for real-world problems.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  )\n);\n","class PageDetail {\n    constructor(company, start, end, image, stack, content, github) {\n      this.company = company;\n      this.start = start;\n      this.end = end;\n      this.image = image;\n      this.stack = stack;\n      this.content = content;\n      this.github = github;\n    }\n  }\n\nexport default PageDetail;","// extracted by mini-css-extract-plugin\nexport default {\"content\":\"asics_content__iumDS\"};"],"names":["PageDetail","Date","className","styles","company","start","end","image","stack","content","github","this"],"sourceRoot":""}
