In just 10 weeks, Britney successfully implemented a new Structured Investments workflow platform using React and Redux, the latter of which she did not have experience in. Additionally, Britney took the initiative to lead the Backend and UX interns in collaborating on their full-stack project, ensuring a fluid, user-friendly experience. Despite our optional in-office policy, Britney's passion for her work and her colleagues drove her to come into the office daily with a positive and productive attitude. I would highly recommend Britney as a strong technical and social addition to any team.\""})]})]}))},4897:function(e,t,n){n.r(t),t.default={content:"simon_content__WIq-l",recommendations:"simon_recommendations__KYKHj"}}}]);
