This gave me a really clear view of what functions\n        I needed in each model and how the controller would interact with them.{\" \"}\n        Building this project was my first exposure to python, as well as the\n        pygame library. I read documentation and looked at samples to figure out\n        how to make my game functional. This completed game comes with all basic\n        features of Tetris, including saving a piece, pausing the game, and\n        scoring.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        View the github repo to learn more about the ncode-specifics and code\n        architecture of the project.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  ),\n  \"https://github.com/britneyart80/Tetris\"\n);\n","// extracted by mini-css-extract-plugin\nexport default {\"content\":\"tetris_content__-XjUm\"};"],"names":["PageDetail","company","start","end","image","stack","content","github","link","this","Date","className","styles"],"sourceRoot":""}
