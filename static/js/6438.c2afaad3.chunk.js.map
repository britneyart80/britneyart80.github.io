The company is\n        based in New York City, where I was stationed, and was recognized as one\n        of Built In's \"2021 Best Places to Work\", \"Best Small Places to Work\",\n        and \"Best Paying Companies\". Over the summer of 2022, I worked as a UI\n        Engineer for the Structured Investments (SI) team.\n      </p>\n      <h5>Project Overview</h5>\n      <p>\n        Currently, many financial advisors gather interest for financial\n        products through word of mouth or via email etc. This process is very\n        manual and lacks organization. To help our clients address this issue, I\n        worked in a team with one design intern and one backend intern to design\n        and develop a crowdsourcing system. The Crowdsourcing Portal would not\n        only allow Financial Advisors to create 'Trade Ideas', but it would also\n        allow them to see other 'Trade Ideas' and put money into investment\n        products that their client is interested in. The portal would also allow\n        administrators to approve 'Trade Ideas' and send them to receive bank\n        quotes when they were ready.\n      </p>\n      <h5>The Process</h5>\n      <p>\n        Throughout the entire summer, the project was extremely collaborative\n        between design, backend and the UI. We as interns met regularly to\n        discuss design decisions, which we would present to the greater team\n        twice a week. Ideas were shared between the UI, design and backend teams\n        and it was amazing to see the kind of results that can be produced when\n        all minds are brought together. I collaborated especially closely with\n        backend, as the architecture greatly impacted how the UI is built. We\n        considered aspects such as MVP requirements, scalability, payload\n        design, and reusability.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        This project was my first time using Redux, and it was exciting to see\n        how the framework is applied in an application that processes huge\n        amounts of data. With only 10 weeks to learn Redux, gather requirements,\n        design and implement the portal, it was an intensive and exciting and\n        learning environment! At the end of the summer, I was able to build the\n        complete UI. I left Simon with a new Crowdsourcing portal as well as a\n        bucket full of new learnings.\n      </p>\n      <h5>Special Thanks</h5>\n      <p>\n        Thank you so much to my manager, Alana, for advocating and rooting for\n        me the entire summer! Big shoutout as well to all the amazing engineers\n        I worked with, who not only taught me with great patience but embraced\n        me into the incredible company culture at SIMON. Best of luck with the\n        iCapital Acquisition :)\n      </p>\n      <h5>Recommendations</h5>\n      <div className={styles.recommendations}>\n        <h6>Alana Ruth - UI Engineer @ Simon Markets (now iCapital)</h6>\n        <p>\n          \"From the day I met Britney, I knew that her strong communication\n          skills, desire to learn, and her extensive real world engineering\n          experience would propel her to make tangible impacts to our team. I\n          was Britney's manager for the Summer 2022 internship program at SIMON\n          (now iCapital); I could not have wished for a more delightful and\n          driven mentee. In just 10 weeks, Britney successfully implemented a\n          new Structured Investments workflow platform using React and Redux,\n          the latter of which she did not have experience in. Additionally,\n          Britney took the initiative to lead the Backend and UX interns in\n          collaborating on their full-stack project, ensuring a fluid,\n          user-friendly experience. Despite our optional in-office policy,\n          Britney's passion for her work and her colleagues drove her to come\n          into the office daily with a positive and productive attitude. I would\n          highly recommend Britney as a strong technical and social addition to\n          any team.\"\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n);\n","// extracted by mini-css-extract-plugin\nexport default {\"content\":\"simon_content__WIq-l\",\"recommendations\":\"simon_recommendations__KYKHj\"};"],"names":["PageDetail","company","start","end","image","stack","content","github","link","this","Date","className","styles"],"sourceRoot":""}
