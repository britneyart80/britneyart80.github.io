Whoop sells wearable straps and the Enterprise team is\n        responsible for building the new B2B solution for Whoop. My role as a\n        Web developer was to build out major features on the Whoop Unite\n        dashboard such as on/offboarding and account management. I collaborated\n        daily with team members to design and build primarily front-end\n        features, but also implemented back-end api endpoints. Below are\n        highlights of some of the features I worked on during my time at Whoop.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Note: I worked on features before launch and certain features may have\n        changed over time! All information shown in the screenshots are mock\n        information to respect the privacy of the company.\n      </p>\n      <div className={styles.csm}>\n        <h5>Highlight #1: CSM Account Dashboard</h5>\n        <Row>\n          <Col s={12}>\n            <p>\n              One of the major features I devleoped was the Customer Success\n              Manager management dashboard. The purpose of this dashboard was\n              for customer success managers to be able to view all their\n              accounts and account stats in one centralized dashboard. For this\n              feature I was the sole developer for both the front-end interface\n              as well as the backend api endpoints.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              This feature was accessible only to those with the correct\n              permissions (i.e CSMs and employees), which were enforced in the\n              backend for security. I collaborated with the senior back end\n              engineer to make decisions on what attributes were needed to\n              display the aggregated data shown on the designs. Then I\n              implemented the SQL query to grab all relevant information from\n              across various tables. After testing and ensuring the robustness\n              of the endpoints, I implemented the front-end in React. The final\n              product allowed CSM's to gain an overview of their accounts and\n              aggregated data, greatly reducing the amount of time spent\n              searching for information, and click into it to view more details\n              about the members in each account.\n            </p>\n          </Col>\n          <Col s={12} className={styles.centerFlex}>\n            <Image path={\"whoop/csm.png\"} />\n          </Col>\n        </Row>\n      </div>\n      <div className={styles.boarding}>\n        <h5>Highlight #2: Offboarding / Onboarding</h5>\n        <Row className={styles.centerFlex}>\n          <Col s={12} l={7} className={styles.centerFlex}>\n            <Image path={\"whoop/offboarding.png\"} />\n          </Col>\n          <Col s={12} l={5}>\n            <p>\n              I was in charge of the implementation for the front-end for our\n              offboarding flow. This flow is used when enterprise accounts want\n              to offboard a member from an account. I collaborated with design\n              to discuss UI/UX implications and error states before and during\n              development of this feature.\n            </p>\n          </Col>\n        </Row>\n        <Row className={`${styles.centerFlex} ${styles.reverse}`}>\n          <Col className={styles.centerFlex} s={12} l={7}>\n            <Image path={\"whoop/onboarding.png\"} />\n          </Col>\n          <Col s={12} l={5}>\n            <p>\n              For the onboarding flow, we needed a clear way to review invitee\n              emails after uploading/inputting them. I was tasked with designing\n              the review process for the invite flow as well as developing it.\n              The design went through multiple iterations with design before\n              approval and implementation.\n            </p>\n          </Col>\n        </Row>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className={styles.concealed}>\n        <h5>Highlight #3: Concealed Mode</h5>\n        <p>\n          As functionality grew, the dashboard needed account settings to manage\n          different use cases. One of these settings was 'Concealed mode', which\n          essentially hid collected data from users so they cannot introduce\n          bias (for medical cases). My goal was to design the page as well as\n          implement it in the front and back end. I collaborated with the\n          designer to design the implemented page as well as future iterations\n          of the page.\n        </p>\n        <Row className={styles.concealedImg}>\n          <Col m={12} l={6}>\n            <Image path={\"whoop/concealed1.png\"} />\n          </Col>\n          <Col m={12} l={6}>\n            <Image path={\"whoop/concealed2.png\"} />\n          </Col>\n        </Row>\n      </div>\n      <div className={styles.highlight}>\n        <h5>Highlight #4: Typography Design System</h5>\n        <p>\n          I took on a side project in an effort to standardize how the web teams\n          were styling applications. Throughout this project, I collabored with\n          designers to come up and implement a typography design system which\n          impacted all 3 web teams across the software department at Whoop.
