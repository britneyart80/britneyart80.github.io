Whoop sells wearable straps and the Enterprise team is\n        responsible for building the new B2B solution for Whoop. My role as a\n        Web developer was to build out major features on the Whoop Unite\n        dashboard such as on/offboarding and account management. I collaborated\n        daily with team members to design and build primarily front-end\n        features, but also implemented back-end api endpoints. Below are\n        highlights of some of the features I worked on during my time at Whoop.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Note: I worked on features before launch and certain features may have\n        changed over time! All information shown in the screenshots are mock\n        information to respect the privacy of the company.\n      </p>\n\n      <h5>Highlight #1: CSM Account Dashboard</h5>\n      <p>\n        One of the major features I devleoped was the Customer Success Manager\n        management dashboard. The purpose of this dashboard was for customer\n        success managers to be able to view all their accounts and account stats\n        in one centralized dashboard. For this feature I was the sole developer\n        for both the front-end interface as well as the backend api endpoints.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        This feature was accessible only to those with the correct permissions\n        (i.e CSMs and employees), which were enforced in the backend for\n        security. I collaborated with the senior back end engineer to make\n        decisions on what attributes were needed to display the aggregated data\n        shown on the designs. Then I implemented the SQL query to grab all\n        relevant information from across various tables. After testing and\n        ensuring the robustness of the endpoints, I implemented the front-end in\n        React. The final product allowed CSM's to gain an overview of their\n        accounts and aggregated data, greatly reducing the amount of time spent\n        searching for information, and click into it to view more details about\n        the members in each account.\n      </p>\n\n      <Row className={styles.centerFlex}>\n        <Image path={\"whoop/csm.png\"} />\n      </Row>\n\n      <h5>Highlight #2: Offboarding / Onboarding</h5>\n      <Row className={styles.centerFlex}>\n        <Col s={12} l={7} className={styles.centerFlex}>\n          <Image path={\"whoop/offboarding.png\"} />\n        </Col>\n        <Col s={12} l={5}>\n          <p>\n            I was in charge of the implementation for the front-end for our\n            offboarding flow. This flow is used when enterprise accounts want to\n            offboard a member from an account. I collaborated with design to\n            discuss UI/UX implications and error states before and during\n            development of this feature.\n          </p>\n        </Col>\n      </Row>\n      <Row className={styles.centerFlex}>\n        <Col className={styles.centerFlex} s={12} l={7}>\n          <Image path={\"whoop/onboarding.png\"} />\n        </Col>\n        <Col s={12} l={5}>\n          <p>\n            For the onboarding flow, we needed a clear way to review invitee\n            emails after uploading/inputting them. I was tasked with designing\n            the review process for the invite flow as well as developing it. The\n            design went through multiple iterations with design before approval\n            and implementation.\n          </p>\n        </Col>\n      </Row>\n      <h5>Highlight #3: Concealed Mode</h5>\n      <p>\n        As functionality grew, the dashboard needed account settings to manage\n        different use cases. One of these settings was 'Concealed mode', which\n        essentially hid collected data from users so they cannot introduce bias\n        (for medical cases). My goal was to design the page as well as implement\n        it in the front and back end. I collaborated with the designer to design\n        the implemented page as well as future iterations of the page.\n      </p>\n      <Row className={styles.concealedImg}>\n        <Col m={12} l={6}>\n          <Image path={\"whoop/concealed1.png\"} />\n        </Col>\n        <Col m={12} l={6}>\n          <Image path={\"whoop/concealed2.png\"} />\n        </Col>\n      </Row>\n      <div className={styles.highlight}>\n        <h5>Highlight #4: Typography Design System</h5>\n        <p>\n          I took on a side project in an effort to standardize how the web teams\n          were styling applications. Throughout this project, I collaborated\n          with designers to come up with and delivered a new design system along\n          with a storybook library, which impacted all 3 web teams across the\n          software department at Whoop.\n        </p>\n        <Row className={styles.centerFlex}>\n          <Col className={styles.centerFlex} s={12} l={7}>\n            <Image path={\"whoop/typography.png\"} />\n          </Col>\n          <Col className={styles.centerFlex} s={12} l={5}>\n            <p>\n              The first step in creating the design system was auditing. I\n              collaborated with design leaders across all 3 departments to\n              understand the current design systems in place and design\n              practices, as well as collect samples from design screens. I\n              compiled a chart of how typography is being used across the web\n              teams so that I could easily compare them.\n            </p>\n          </Col>\n        </Row>\n        <Row className={styles.centerFlex}>\n          <Col className={styles.centerFlex} s={12} l={7}>\n            <Image path={\"whoop/recommendation.png\"} />\n          </Col>\n          <Col className={styles.centerFlex} s={12} l={5}>\n            <p>\n              I composed a design system recommendation that was a middle ground\n              for all the similarities and differences after comparing them\n              using the above chart. I kept in mind that our customer facing\n              styles should take priority, as any large changes on that end can\n              disrupt the user experience and have larger consequences for the\n              brand image.\n            </p>\n          </Col>\n        </Row>\n        <p>\n          After multiple rounds of approvals and tweaking, I documented and\n          built the design system into a shared storybook library so developers\n          could easily implement it into the code base. Type styles were only\n          applied within \".whoop-typography\" containers so they were opt-in.\n          Furthermore, the design system accounted for multiple display widths\n          and perfectly aligned with the existing mobile design system, which\n          ensures scalability and creates consistentcy across the brand.\n        </p>\n        <Row className={styles.centerFlex}>\n          <Col className={styles.centerFlex} s={12} l={7}>\n            <Image path={\"whoop/spacing.png\"} />\n          </Col>\n          <Col className={styles.centerFlex} s={12} l={5}>\n            <p>\n              In addition to creating a typography design system, the design\n              team decided that we wanted to move towards a 4px grid system.\n              This creates visual comfort for the user. To do this, I\n              implemented a spacing library onto storybook so developers can\n              easily access and implement predefined space using classes and\n              variables.\n            </p>\n          </Col>\n        </Row>\n      </div>\n      <h5>Special Thanks</h5>\n      <p>\n        I want to give a huge shoutout to the amazing team I got to work with!\n        Thank you so much to Mark Flores and my enterprise team, as well as the\n        incredible design team for such an amazing co-op experience.

Her direct team\n          loved working with her and she consistently delivered. Finally,\n          Britney went above and beyond by partnering with Design directly to\n          help out.

We worked together on\n          the enterprise team during her 6 month co-op with WHOOP in 2021. As\n          the product design lead, Britney and I collaborated on a daily basis\n          where I would review her front-end contributions to the product, as\n          well as task her with supporting me in design projects. I challenged\n          Britney to jump into a new realm of sketching ideas, prototyping in\n          Figma, presenting solutions in the perspective of the user in design\n          critiques, to then taking her ideas and building them right into the\n          product. She blew me away with her optimism towards navigating\n          ambiguous territories and willingness to do more than the average\n          engineer would be expected to. She would take initiative and even\n          share articles with me on UX trends that would leave me learning more\n          about building scalable products through our collaboration. Britney\n          brings a go-get-it attitude with an eagerness to take in and learn as\n          much as she can, takes feedback well, and brings a special energy to\n          the team that makes coming to work together a pleasure. She would be a\n          fabulous addition to any team, and I would be thrilled to call her my\n          co-worker again one day!\"\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n);\n","// extracted by mini-css-extract-plugin\nexport default {\"content\":\"whoop_content__XND00\",\"centerFlex\":\"whoop_centerFlex__njitt\",\"recommendations\":\"whoop_recommendations__qF0HB\"};"],"names":["PageDetail","company","start","end","image","stack","content","github","link","this","Date","className","styles","path","s","l","m"],"sourceRoot":""}
